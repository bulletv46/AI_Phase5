# Prerequisites:

Before you can run this chatbot, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
-> Python 3.x
-> NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

# Installation:

1.Clone this repository to local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/adhirajan721/simple-python-chatbot.git

2.Change to the project directory:
    cd simple-python-chatbot

3.Install NLTK and the required datasets:
    pip install nltk

4.After installing NLTK, you need to download the necessary datasets. To do this, run the following code in a Python shell:

    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')

# Usage

To use the chatbot, follow these steps:

1.Run the chatbot script:

    python chatbot.py

2.The chatbot will greet you and wait for your input.

3.Type your questions or commands, and the chatbot will respond based on the predefined rules.

4.To exit the chatbot, simply type "exit" or press Ctrl + C.

# Adding Rules

To customize the chatbot and add new rules, you can edit the chatbot_rules.py file. This file contains a dictionary with input patterns and their corresponding responses. You can modify, add, or remove rules as needed.

Example rule in chatbot_rules.py:

{
    "input_pattern": ["hello", "hi", "hey"],
    "response": "Hello! How can I assist you?"
}
Please make sure to follow the same format when adding new rules.
